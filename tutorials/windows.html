<p>
The Shaka Player library's build scripts assume the presence of tools which are
readily available on Linux and Mac systems. If you need to build the library on
Windows, you can use <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> to provide the
necessary tools.
</p>

<p>
Simply install Cygwin and take care to select these non-default packages:

<ul>
  <li>git</li>
  <li>python</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In addition to Cygwin, you will need to have a Java runtime environment such as
JRE 7 or better. Java should be in your PATH, and "java -version" should report
at least version 1.7.
</p>

<p>
Once the installation is complete, simply follow the normal build procedures as
outlined in <a href="tutorial-dev.html">Shaka Player Development</a>.
</p>
